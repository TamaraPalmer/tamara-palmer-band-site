            <p class="sub-header">"We push each other to be the best. It’s not uncommon for one of us to say ‘this
                needs to
                be better, back to the drawing board’ "</p>

            <p class="body-copy">The Bees Knees is a pop rock band originating from San Francisco, California.
                The band
                consists of lead vocalist Bryan Teddy, guitarist Mack Tolkens, guitarist Andrew Green, bassist
                Kent Zulkee
                and drummer Freddie Fischer. The band achieved its first commercial success as an unsigned act,
                drawing
                attention from manager Cam Adams. Having worked with other popular acts (The Elephant In The
                Room, One Trick
                Pony, The Cat’s Meow), Adams was confident the band could succeed even further, pushing them to
                sign with
                Magenta Records. </p>
            <p class="body-copy">From there, the band has soared, gaining international recognition and ranking
                in the top
                10 on the Poster Charts. New fans immediately fell in love with the band’s original and organic
                attitude,
                solidifying their place as one of the hottest and fastest up and coming acts of this century.
                Fans
                affectionately refer to themselves as “The Hive” and are drawn to their candid and authentic
                performances on
                stage. Looking forward to touring in the future, The Bees Knees are currently recording their
                second studio
                album, looking to be released in late 2021.</p>
